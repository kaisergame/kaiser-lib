##  Publishing

To publish this as an npm package, follow these steps:

1. Update the version in package.json using the [semver](https://semver.org/) standard.
2. Create a new `release`, and match up its version number with the version in the package.json, just make sure the prefix it with a `v`. So if it's version `1.2.1` in package.json, then in Github it should be `v1.2.1`.
3. Once you've created the release, it should automatically create the package.
